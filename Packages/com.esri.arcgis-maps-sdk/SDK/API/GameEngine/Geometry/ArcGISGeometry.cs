    /// Base class for all classes that represent geometric shapes.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometry">ArcGISGeometry</see> is the base class for two-dimensional (x,y) and three-dimensional (x,y,z) geometries, such as
    /// <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPoint">ArcGISPoint</see>, <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISMultipoint">ArcGISMultipoint</see>, <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPolyline">ArcGISPolyline</see>, <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPolygon">ArcGISPolygon</see>, and <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISEnvelope">ArcGISEnvelope</see>. It represents real-world objects by
    /// defining a shape at a specific geographic location, and is used throughout the API to represent the shapes of
    /// features and graphics, layer extents, viewpoints, and GPS locations. It is also used to define the
    /// inputs and outputs for spatial analysis and geoprocessing operations, and to measure distances and areas.
    /// 
    /// All types of geometry have the following characteristics:
    /// * A <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISSpatialReference">ArcGISSpatialReference</see> indicating the coordinate system used by its coordinates.
    /// * Can be empty, indicating that they have no specific location or shape.
    /// * May have z-values and/or m-values to define elevation and measures, respectively.
    /// * Can be converted to and from JSON to be persisted or to be exchanged directly with REST services.
    /// 
    /// Immutability
    /// 
    /// Most geometries are created and not changed for their lifetime. Examples include features
    /// created to be stored in a geodatabase or read from a non-editable layer, and features returned
    /// from tasks such as a spatial query, geocode operation, network trace, or geoprocessing task.
    /// Immutable geometries (geometries that cannot be changed) offer important benefits to your app. They are
    /// inherently thread-safe, help prevent inadvertent changes, and allow for certain performance optimizations.
    /// 
    /// If you want to modify the shape of a <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometry">ArcGISGeometry</see> there are two options available:
    /// * <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometryBuilder">ArcGISGeometryBuilder</see>. Use a geometry builder if you want to incrementally reshape a geometry. If you want to
    ///   reshape a <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPolygon">ArcGISPolygon</see>, for example, then pass the polygon to a <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPolygonBuilder">ArcGISPolygonBuilder</see>. The polygon builder copies
    ///   the polygon and provides methods to add, update, and delete the polygon parts and segment vertices.
    ///   The geometry builder represents the state of a geometry under modification, and you can obtain it at any time
    ///   using <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometryBuilder.ToGeometry">ArcGISGeometryBuilder.ToGeometry</see>.
    /// * <see cref="">GeometryEditor</see>. Use a geometry editor if you want to allow the user to interactively modify an existing
    ///   geometry. Start the <see cref="">GeometryEditor</see> by passing the geometry to <see cref="">GeometryEditor.start(Geometry)</see>. The start
    ///   method signals to the geometry editor to start capturing user interaction with the map through mouse or
    ///   touch gestures.
    /// 
    /// Note that the <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometryEngine">ArcGISGeometryEngine</see> offers a range of topological and spatial transformations that can create a new
    /// geometry from an existing geometry. The <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometryEngine">ArcGISGeometryEngine</see> allows you to perform actions on an existing
    /// geometry, such as a buffer, cut, clip, densify, or project, to produce a new output geometry. See
    /// <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometryEngine">ArcGISGeometryEngine</see> to explore various supported geometric operations.
    /// 
    /// Coordinate units
    /// 
    /// The coordinates that define a geometry are only meaningful in the context of the geometry's
    /// <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISSpatialReference">ArcGISSpatialReference</see>. The vertices and spatial reference together allow your app to translate a
    /// real-world object from its location on the Earth to its location on your map or scene.
    /// 
    /// In some cases, a geometry's spatial reference may not be set. For example, a <see cref="">Graphic</see> that
    /// does not have a spatial reference is drawn using the same spatial reference as the <see cref="">GeoView</see>
    /// to which it was added. If the coordinates are in a different spatial reference, the graphics may
    /// not display in the correct location, or at all.
    /// 
    /// When using <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometryBuilder">ArcGISGeometryBuilder</see> to create a <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPolyline">ArcGISPolyline</see> or <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPolygon">ArcGISPolygon</see> from a collection of
    /// <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISPoint">ArcGISPoint</see>, you don't need to set the spatial reference of every point before you add it to
    /// the builder, as it is assigned the spatial reference of the builder itself. In most other
    /// cases, such as when using a geometry in geometry operations or when editing a feature table,
    /// <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISGeometry.SpatialReference">ArcGISGeometry.SpatialReference</see> must be set.

    /// 
    /// Changing the coordinates of a geometry to have the same shape and location represented using a
    /// different <see cref="GameEngine.Geometry.ArcGISSpatialReference">ArcGISSpatialReference</see> is known as "projection" or sometimes as "reprojection". Because
